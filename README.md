# BrightTV Case Study – Viewership Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview
This case study analyzes **BrightTV’s user profiles and viewer transactions** to provide actionable insights for the **Customer Value Management (CVM) team**.  
The CEO’s objective is to **grow the subscription base** and improve content consumption for the financial year.  

The dataset captures **session-level viewing behavior**, which was used to uncover user trends, content preferences, and factors influencing consumption.  
All timestamps were converted from **UTC → South Africa Standard Time (SAST)** for accurate local analysis.

## 🔑 Process
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Cleaned raw transactional data.  
   - Converted timestamps from UTC → SAST.  
   - Created calculated fields (e.g., session duration, total consumption per user).

2. **Exploratory Analysis**
   - Analyzed user demographics (age, region, subscription type).  
   - Identified peak consumption hours and low-activity days.  
   - Segmented users by engagement level (heavy vs. light viewers).

3. **Content Analysis**
   - Compared consumption across genres (sports, drama, kids, news).  
   - Identified underperforming content categories.  
   - Recommended content types to boost engagement during low-consumption days.

4. **Recommendations**
   - Suggested **marketing campaigns** targeting low-consumption days.  
   - Recommended **content bundles** (e.g., sports + drama) to increase session length.  
   - Proposed **loyalty initiatives** to retain high-value users.  
   - Highlighted opportunities for **personalized recommendations** using viewing history.
